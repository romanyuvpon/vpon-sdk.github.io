This is the test page for internal usage. Of course, if publishers are in need of any real test page, this can be what they want. Anyway, tests can be put to here, but remember to list the pages you've created below in links.

There are three tests that you can check.

1. [Web SDK test](web-test)
2. [SSP Interstitial Test](ssp)
3. [SSP Interstitial with DFP Test](ssp/dfp)
4. [mingpao2](ssp/mingpao2)
