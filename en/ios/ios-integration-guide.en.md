# Vpon SDK Fundamental
---
1. Check your ad network from registering url first:<br>
Taiwan is: <http://tw.pub.vpon.com/><br>
China is: <http://cn.pub.vpon.com/><br>

2. If you register platform in Taiwan, please use:`vpadnAd.platform = @"TW"`;

3. If you register platform in China, please use:`vpadnAd.platform = @"CN"`;

4.  If you cannot see `didImpression` from log after updating to iOS8, it is probably because there is no window's width*hight by default. So you have to manually adjust it by calling setFrame. Notice, Seeing the `didImpression` is the correct way of integration.

# Overview
---
Banner ads use a small portion of the screen to entice users to "click through" to a richer, full-screen experience such as a website or app store page. To display banner ads in your iOS app, simply import Vpadn SDK in Xcode project and add a VpadnBanner to your UI.

# Requirement
---
* iOS version 5.0 or later
* Xcode 4.4 or later

# Import SDK
---
Vpon provides two SDKs serving the same functions for our publishers. You should choose either of these 2 for integration.<br>
  1. Fundamental SDK (Require iOS 5.0+)<br>
  2. Framework SDK (Require iOS 8.0+)

There is slight difference between these two SDKs, which we will explain in introduction of Framework SDK.

## Framework SDK
---
Framework SDK is a dynamic library, our latest SDK within any necessary references, headers and lib, needs fewer steps, and is lighter than Fundamental SDK.

However, this convenient way is only for apps designed for iOS version higher than 8.0. If you are targeting at users with devices OS version lower than 8.0, you should definitely choose the [fundamental SDK](#fundamental-sdk) instead.

First, right-click your project and choose `Add Files to your_project`
<img src="{{site.imgurl}}/ios_framework_1.png" alt="" class="width-300" />

Second, add `VpadnSDKAdKit.framework` into your project.
![]({{site.imgurl}}/ios_framework_2.png)

Remember to check whether the framework  in `Linked Frameworks and Libraries` under `General` has been added.
![]({{site.imgurl}}/ios_framework_7.png)

Third, find `Other Linker Flags` under `Build Settings` and input `-ObjC`
![]({{site.imgurl}}/ios_framework_6.png)

Finally, import the framework:

```Objective-C
@import VpadnSDKAdKit
```
![]({{site.imgurl}}/ios_framework_5.png)

> **Note:** <br>
> Remind again that Framework SDK only support devices in iOS version higher than 8.0 and do not use this SDK if your app targets at users with devices OS version lower than 8.0.



## Fundamental SDK
---
The decompressed SDK consists of Objective-C, a runtime library and a README. Show Vpadn banner on your Android App, you must complete three steps:

1. Import `libAdOn.a`, `VpadnBanner.h` and `VpadnInterstitial.h`
2. Add all iOS development frameworks
3. Add  `-all_load` and `-Obj-C` under `Other Linker Flags` of `Build Settings`. Click the `Build Phases` and set the `AdSupport` framework to `Optional`.

> **Note**: **All three** these steps are necessary!

### Add SDK lib
The decompressed SDK consists of a lib file and two header files.

1. Right-click on your project in Xcode, choose Add Files to "Vpadn_BannerInter_x5"
![IOS-add-file_vpadn.png]
2. Choose `libAdOn.a`, `VpadnBanner.h` and `VpadnInterstitial.h` in SDK
<img src="{{site.imgurl}}/IOS-add-lib&header_vpadn.png" alt="" class="width-300"/>

### Add Framework
The SDK library references the a few iOS development frameworks.<br>

1.Add all the following frameworks.<br>
`AdSupport`, <br>
`AssetsLibrary`, <br>
`AudioToolbox`, <br>
`AVFoundation`, <br>
`CoreFoundation`, <br>
`CoreGraphics`, <br>
`CoreLocation`, <br>
`CoreMedia`, <br>
`CoreMotion`, <br>
`CoreTelephony`, <br>
`EventKit`, <br>
`Foundation`, <br>
`MediaPlayer`, <br>
`MessageUI`, <br>
`MobileCoreServices`, <br>
`QuartzCore`, <br>
`Security`, <br>
`StoreKit`, <br>
`SystemConfiguration`, <br>
`UIKit`<br>

To add these frameworks, double-click the project name. Open the Link Binary With Libraries dropdown under the Build phases tab. Add the frameworks from the iOS SDK using the `+` button that becomes visible.

Apple recently brought a new security feature, App Transport Security (ATS), to iOS9. If you are using the latest Xcode 7 to build or migrate to an iOS9 project, please refer to [this link] for some modification.
